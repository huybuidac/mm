# Technical Implementation Template Guide

## Critical Rules

- Always analyze user prompts to identify the technical task they want to implement
- Check for corresponding implementation guides in the `.cursor/guides/` directory
- Follow the specific guide's implementation steps and best practices
- If no guide exists, suggest creating one for future reference
- For each implementation:
  1. Analyze requirements and constraints
  2. Confirm implementation details with user
  3. Follow guide-specific steps
  4. Document any deviations or extensions

## Implementation Guides

Current guides and their triggers:

1. **Warmup Implementation** (`.cursor/guides/warmup.md`)
   - Trigger: User wants to implement Lambda warmup
   - Keywords: "warmup", "cold start", "lambda warming"
   - Action: Follow warmup.md guidelines for implementation

## Examples

<example>
User: "I want to add warmup to my API Lambda"
Action: 
1. Identify warmup implementation request
2. Reference .cursor/guides/warmup.md
3. Follow implementation steps:
   - Add CDK warmup configuration
   - Analyze and suggest concurrency
   - Add warmup handler logic
</example>

<example type="invalid">
User: "I want to add warmup to my Lambda"
Action: Immediately implementing without:
- Checking .cursor/guides/warmup.md guide
- Analyzing concurrency requirements
- Following standardized implementation
</example>
